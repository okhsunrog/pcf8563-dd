[1] The die paddle (exposed pad) is connected to $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SS}}$ through high ohmic (non-conductive) silicon attach and should be electrically isolated. It is good engineering practice to solder the exposed pad to an electrically isolated PCB copper pad for better heat transfer but it is not required as the RTC doesn't consume much power. In no case should traces be run under the package exposed pad.

# 8. Functional description 

The PCF8563 contains sixteen 8-bit registers with an auto-incrementing register address, an on-chip 32.768 kHz oscillator with one integrated capacitor, a frequency divider which provides the source clock for the Real-Time Clock (RTC) and calender, a programmable clock output, a timer, an alarm, a voltage-low detector, and a $400 \mathrm{kHz} \mathrm{I}^{2} \mathrm{C}$-bus interface.

All 16 registers are designed as addressable 8-bit parallel registers although not all bits are implemented. The first two registers (memory address 00 h and 01 h ) are used as control and/or status registers. The memory addresses 02 h through 08 h are used as counters for the clock function (seconds up to years counters). Address locations 09h through 0 Ch contain alarm registers which define the conditions for an alarm. Address 0 Dh controls the CLKOUT output frequency. 0Eh and 0Fh are the Timer_control and Timer registers, respectively.

The Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Months, Years as well as the Minute_alarm, Hour_alarm, and Day_alarm registers are all coded in Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) format.

When one of the RTC registers is written or read, the contents of all time counters are frozen. Therefore, faulty writing or reading of the clock and calendar during a carry condition is prevented.

### 8.1 CLKOUT output

A programmable square wave is available at the CLKOUT pin. Operation is controlled by the register CLKOUT_control at address 0Dh. Frequencies of 32.768 kHz (default), $1.024 \mathrm{kHz}, 32 \mathrm{~Hz}$, and 1 Hz can be generated for use as a system clock, microcontroller clock, input to a charge pump, or for calibration of the oscillator. CLKOUT is an open-drain output and enabled at power-on. If disabled it becomes high-impedance.

[2] Default value.

# 8.3.2.1 Interrupt output 

Bits TF and AF: When an alarm occurs, AF is set to logic 1. Similarly, at the end of a timer countdown, TF is set to logic 1. These bits maintain their value until overwritten using the interface. If both timer and alarm interrupts are required in the application, the source of the interrupt can be determined by reading these bits. To prevent one flag being overwritten while clearing another, a logic AND is performed during a write access.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

When bits TIE and AIE are disabled, pin $\overline{\mathrm{INT}}$ will remain high-impedance.
Fig 5. Interrupt scheme

Bits TIE and AIE: These bits activate or deactivate the generation of an interrupt when TF or AF is asserted, respectively. The interrupt is the logical OR of these two conditions when both AIE and TIE are set.

# Page 9

Countdown timer interrupts: The pulse generator for the countdown timer interrupt uses an internal clock and is dependent on the selected source clock for the countdown timer and on the countdown value $n$. As a consequence, the width of the interrupt pulse varies (see Table 7).

Table 7. $\overline{\text { INT }}$ operation (bit TI_TP $=1$ )[1]

| Source clock $(\mathrm{Hz})$ | $\overline{\text { INT }}$ period (s) |  |

# 8.4.1.1 Voltage-low detector and clock monitor 

The PCF8563 has an on-chip voltage-low detector (see Figure 6). When $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{DD}}$ drops below $\mathrm{V}_{\text {low }}$, bit VL in the VL_seconds register is set to indicate that the integrity of the clock information is no longer guaranteed. The VL flag can only be cleared by using the interface.
![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

Fig 6. Voltage-low detection
The VL flag is intended to detect the situation when $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{DD}}$ is decreasing slowly, for example under battery operation. Should the oscillator stop or $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{DD}}$ reach $\mathrm{V}_{\text {low }}$ before power is re-asserted, then the VL flag is set. This will indicate that the time may be corrupted.

### 8.5 Setting and reading the time

Figure 7 shows the data flow and data dependencies starting from the 1 Hz clock tick.
![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

Fig 7. Data flow for the time function
During read/write operations, the time counting circuits (memory locations 02h through 08 h ) are blocked.

This prevents

- Faulty reading of the clock and calendar during a carry condition
- Incrementing the time registers, during the read cycle

# Page 13

After this read/write access is completed, the time circuit is released again and any pending request to increment the time counters that occurred during the read access is serviced. A maximum of 1 request can be stored; therefore, all accesses must be completed within 1 second (see Figure 8).
![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

Fig 8. Access time for read/write operations
As a consequence of this method, it is very important to make a read or write access in one go, that is, setting or reading seconds through to years should be made in one single access. Failing to comply with this method could result in the time becoming corrupted.

As an example, if the time (seconds through to hours) is set in one access and then in a second access the date is set, it is possible that the time may increment between the two accesses. A similar problem exists when reading. A roll over may occur between reads thus giving the minutes from one moment and the hours from the next.

Recommended method for reading the time:

1. Send a START condition and the slave address for write (A2h).
2. Set the address pointer to 2 (VL_seconds) by sending 02h.
3. Send a RESTART condition or STOP followed by START.
4. Send the slave address for read (A3h).
5. Read VL_seconds.
6. Read Minutes.
7. Read Hours.
8. Read Days.
9. Read Weekdays.
10. Read Century_months.
11. Read Years.
12. Send a STOP condition.

[1] Default value.

### 8.6.5 Alarm flag

By clearing the alarm enable bit (AE_x) of one or more of the alarm registers, the corresponding alarm condition(s) are active. When an alarm occurs, AF is set to logic 1. The asserted AF can be used to generate an interrupt ( $\overline{I N T}$ ). The AF is cleared using the interface.

The registers at addresses 09 h through 0 Ch contain alarm information. When one or more of these registers is loaded with minute, hour, day or weekday, and its corresponding AE_x is logic 0 , then that information is compared with the current minute, hour, day, and weekday. When all enabled comparisons first match, the alarm flag (AF in register Control_2) is set to logic 1.

# Page 15

The generation of interrupts from the alarm function is controlled via bit AIE. If bit AIE is enabled, the $\overline{\mathrm{INT}}$ pin follows the condition of bit AF. AF will remain set until cleared by the interface. Once AF has been cleared, it will only be set again when the time increments to match the alarm condition once more. Alarm registers which have their $\mathrm{AE} \_x$ bit at logic 1 are ignored.
![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)
(1) Only when all enabled alarm settings are matching.

It's only on increment to a matched case that the alarm flag is set, see Section 8.6.5.

# 8.8 Timer function 

The 8 -bit countdown timer at address 0 Fh is controlled by the Timer_control register at address 0Eh. The Timer_control register determines one of 4 source clock frequencies for the timer ( $4096 \mathrm{~Hz}, 64 \mathrm{~Hz}, 1 \mathrm{~Hz}$, or $1 / 60 \mathrm{~Hz}$ ), and enables or disables the timer. The timer counts down from a software-loaded 8 -bit binary value. At the end of every countdown, the timer sets the timer flag TF. The TF may only be cleared by using the interface. The asserted TF can be used to generate an interrupt on pin $\overline{\mathrm{INT}}$. The interrupt may be generated as a pulsed signal every countdown period or as a permanently active signal which follows the state of TF. Bit TI_TP is used to control this mode selection. When reading the timer, the current countdown value is returned.

The register Timer is an 8-bit binary countdown timer. It is enabled and disabled via the Timer_control register bit TE. The source clock for the timer is also selected by the Timer_control register. Other timer properties such as interrupt generation are controlled via the register Control_status_2.

For accurate read back of the count down value, it is recommended to read the register twice and check for consistent results, since it is not possible to freeze the countdown timer counter during read back.

# Page 17

# 8.9 EXT_CLK test mode 

A test mode is available which allows for on-board testing. In such a mode it is possible to set up test conditions and control the operation of the RTC.

The test mode is entered by setting bit TEST1 in register Control_status_1. Then pin CLKOUT becomes an input. The test mode replaces the internal 64 Hz signal with the signal applied to pin CLKOUT. Every 64 positive edges applied to pin CLKOUT will then generate an increment of one second.

The signal applied to pin CLKOUT should have a minimum pulse width of 300 ns and a maximum period of 1000 ns . The internal 64 Hz clock, now sourced from CLKOUT, is divided down to 1 Hz by a $2^{6}$ divide chain called a prescaler. The prescaler can be set into a known state by using bit STOP. When bit STOP is set, the prescaler is reset to 0 (STOP must be cleared before the prescaler can operate again).

From a STOP condition, the first 1 second increment will take place after 32 positive edges on CLKOUT. Thereafter, every 64 positive edges will cause a one-second increment.

Remark: Entry into EXT_CLK test mode is not synchronized to the internal 64 Hz clock. When entering the test mode, no assumption as to the state of the prescaler can be made.

### 8.9.1 Operation example:

1. Set EXT_CLK test mode (Control_status_1, bit TEST1 = 1).
2. Set STOP (Control_status_1, bit STOP = 1).
3. Clear STOP (Control_status_1, bit STOP = 0).
4. Set time registers to desired value.
5. Apply 32 clock pulses to CLKOUT.
6. Read time registers to see the first change.
7. Apply 64 clock pulses to CLKOUT.
8. Read time registers to see the second change.

Repeat steps 7 and 8 for additional increments.

# Page 18

# 8.10 STOP bit function 

The function of the STOP bit is to allow for accurate starting of the time circuits. The STOP bit function will cause the upper part of the prescaler $\left(F_{2}\right.$ to $\left.F_{14}\right)$ to be held in reset and thus no 1 Hz ticks will be generated (see Figure 10). The time circuits can then be set and will not increment until the STOP bit is released (see Figure 11 and Table 26).
![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

Fig 10. STOP bit functional diagram
The STOP bit function will not affect the output of 32.768 kHz on CLKOUT, but will stop the generation of $1.024 \mathrm{kHz}, 32 \mathrm{~Hz}$, and 1 Hz .

The lower two stages of the prescaler $\left(F_{0}\right.$ and $\left.F_{1}\right)$ are not reset; and because the $\mathrm{I}^{2} \mathrm{C}$-bus is asynchronous to the crystal oscillator, the accuracy of re-starting the time circuits will be between zero and one 8.192 kHz cycle (see Figure 11).

[1] $F_{0}$ is clocked at 32.768 kHz .
The first increment of the time circuits is between 0.507813 s and 0.507935 s after STOP bit is released. The uncertainty is caused by the prescaler bits $F_{0}$ and $F_{1}$ not being reset (see Table 26) and the unknown state of the 32 kHz clock.

# 8.11 Reset 

The PCF8563 includes an internal reset circuit which is active whenever the oscillator is stopped. In the reset state the $\mathrm{I}^{2} \mathrm{C}$-bus logic is initialized including the address pointer and all registers are set according to Table 27. I²C-bus communication is not possible during reset.

# 8.11.1 Power-On Reset (POR) override 

The POR duration is directly related to the crystal oscillator start-up time. Due to the long start-up times experienced by these types of circuits, a mechanism has been built in to disable the POR and hence speed up on-board test of the device. The setting of this mode requires that the $\mathrm{I}^{2} \mathrm{C}$-bus pins, SDA and SCL, are toggled in a specific order as shown in Figure 12. All timings are required minimums.

Once the override mode has been entered, the device immediately stops, being reset, and normal operation may commence i.e. entry into the EXT_CLK test mode via $\mathrm{I}^{2} \mathrm{C}$-bus access. The override mode may be cleared by writing logic 0 to TESTC. TESTC must be set to logic 1 before re-entry into the override mode is possible. Setting TESTC to logic 0 during normal operation has no effect except to prevent entry into the POR override mode.
![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)

Fig 12. POR override sequence

# Page 21

# 9. Characteristics of the $\mathrm{I}^{2} \mathrm{C}$-bus 

The $\mathrm{I}^{2} \mathrm{C}$-bus is for bidirectional, two-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two lines are a Serial DAta line (SDA) and a Serial CLock line (SCL). Both lines must be connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.

### 9.1 Bit transfer

One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time will be interpreted as a control signal (see Figure 13).
![img-10.jpeg](img-10.jpeg)

Fig 13. Bit transfer

### 9.2 START and STOP conditions

Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy.
A HIGH-to-LOW transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition - S.

A LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP condition - P (see Figure 14).
![img-11.jpeg](img-11.jpeg)

## 9.3 System configuration

A device generating a message is a transmitter; a device receiving a message is a receiver. The device that controls the message is the master; and the devices which are controlled by the master are the slaves (see Figure 15).

# Page 22

![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)

Fig 15. System configuration

# 9.4 Acknowledge 

The number of data bytes transferred between the START and STOP conditions from transmitter to receiver is unlimited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by an acknowledge cycle.

- A slave receiver, which is addressed, must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte.
- Also a master receiver must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter.
- The device that acknowledges must pull-down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse (set-up and hold times must be taken into consideration).
- A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP condition.

Acknowledgement on the $\mathrm{I}^{2} \mathrm{C}$-bus is illustrated in Figure 16.

Fig 16. Acknowledgement on the $\mathrm{I}^{2} \mathrm{C}$-bus

# 9.5 ${ }^{12} \mathrm{C}$-bus protocol 

### 9.5.1 Addressing

Before any data is transmitted on the $\mathrm{I}^{2} \mathrm{C}$-bus, the device which should respond is addressed first. The addressing is always carried out with the first byte transmitted after the start procedure.

The PCF8563 acts as a slave receiver or slave transmitter. Therefore the clock signal SCL is only an input signal, but the data signal SDA is a bidirectional line.

Two slave addresses are reserved for the PCF8563:
Read: A3h (10100011)
Write: A2h (10100010)
The PCF8563 slave address is illustrated in Figure 17.
![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)

Fig 17. Slave address

### 9.5.2 Clock and calendar READ or WRITE cycles

The $\mathrm{I}^{2} \mathrm{C}$-bus configuration for the different PCF8563 READ and WRITE cycles is shown in Figure 18, Figure 19 and Figure 20. The register address is a 4-bit value that defines which register is to be accessed next. The upper four bits of the register address are not used.

# 9.6 Interface watchdog timer 

![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)

During read/write operations, the time counting circuits are frozen. To prevent a situation where the accessing device becomes locked and does not clear the interface, the PCF8563 has a built in watchdog timer. Should the interface be active for more than 1 s from the time a valid slave address is transmitted, then the PCF8563 will automatically clear the interface and allow the time counting circuits to continue counting. The watchdog will trigger between 1 s and 2 s after receiving a valid slave address. Each time the watchdog period is exceeded, 1 s will be lost from the time counters.

The watchdog is implemented to prevent the excessive loss of time due to interface access failure e.g. if main power is removed from a battery backed-up system during an interface access.

[1] For reliable oscillator start-up at power on use $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{DD}}$ greater than 1.3 V . If powered up at 1.0 V the oscillator will start but it might be a bit slow, especially if at high temperature. Normally the power supply is not 1.0 V at start up and only comes at the end of battery discharge. $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{DD}}$ min of 1.0 V is specified so that the customer can calculate how large a battery or capacitor they need for their application. $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{DD}} \mathrm{min}$ of 1.3 V or greater is needed to ensure speedy oscillator start-up time.

Fig 28. Application diagram

### 14.1 Quartz frequency adjustment

### 14.1.1 Method 1: fixed OSCI capacitor

By evaluating the average capacitance necessary for the application layout, a fixed capacitor can be used. The frequency is best measured via the 32.768 kHz signal available after power-on at pin CLKOUT. The frequency tolerance depends on the quartz crystal tolerance, the capacitor tolerance and the device-to-device tolerance (on average $\pm 5 \mathrm{ppm}$ ). Average deviations of $\pm 5$ minutes per year can be easily achieved.

### 14.1.2 Method 2: OSCI trimmer

Using the 32.768 kHz signal available after power-on at pin CLKOUT, fast setting of a trimmer is possible.

### 14.1.3 Method 3: OSCO output

Direct measurement of OSCO out (accounting for test probe capacitance).

## 17. Soldering of SMD packages

This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 "Surface mount reflow soldering description".

### 17.1 Introduction to soldering

Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high densities that come with increased miniaturization.

### 17.2 Wave and reflow soldering

Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:

- Through-hole components
- Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board

Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than $\sim 0.6 \mathrm{~mm}$ cannot be wave soldered, due to an increased probability of bridging.

The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.

Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:

- Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
- Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
- The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
- Package placement
- Inspection and repair
- Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

# Page 37

# 17.3 Wave soldering 

Key characteristics in wave soldering are:

- Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are exposed to the wave
- Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities


### 17.4 Reflow soldering

Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:

- Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 32) than a SnPb process, thus reducing the process window
- Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process window for a mix of large and small components on one board
- Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with Table 31 and 32

Table 31. SnPb eutectic process (from J-STD-020D)

| Package thickness (mm) | Package reflow temperature $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
|  | Volume $\left(\mathrm{mm}^{3}\right)$ |  |  |
|  | $<350$ | $\geq 350$ |  |
| $<2.5$ | 235 | 220 |  |
| $\geq 2.5$ | 220 | 220 |  |

Table 32. Lead-free process (from J-STD-020D)

| Package thickness (mm) | Package reflow temperature $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
|  | Volume $\left(\mathrm{mm}^{3}\right)$ |  |  |
|  | $<350$ | 350 to 2000 | $>2000$ |
| $<1.6$ | 260 | 260 | 260 |
| 1.6 to 2.5 | 260 | 250 | 245 |
| $>2.5$ | 250 | 245 | 245 |

Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all times.

Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow soldering, see Figure 32.
